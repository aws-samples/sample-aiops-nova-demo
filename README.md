## Overview
In this blog, you will learn how to use Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Nova Pro to create an AI-powered incident response system. Amazon Bedrock offers a flexible foundation for building tailored generative AI solutions that can enhance incident response processes by incorporating AWS observability tools data, third-party data sources, and application architecture diagrams. Amazon Bedrock offers a serverless API that gives you access to state-of-the-art foundation models, while Amazon Nova Pro provides advanced multimodal capabilities that can process both text and visual data simultaneously.
