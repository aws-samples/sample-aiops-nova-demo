## Likely Causes of the Issue

Based on the provided documents, the following are likely causes of the issue, ranked by probability:

1. **Network Configuration Issue**:
   - The recent change in the security group configuration (`sg-1234567890123`) could be blocking access to the frontend website. The change added a rule allowing HTTP traffic on port 299, which may not be the correct port for the frontend service.

2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB) Misconfiguration**:
   - The ALB metrics show a high number of `HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count` for the `Servic-PetSi-OcbZLiL0VAGu/123456789012` ALB, indicating potential issues with the backend services or the ALB configuration itself.

3. **Service Performance Degradation**:
   - The X-Ray data shows increased response times and faults for the `PetSite` service, suggesting that the service itself may be experiencing performance issues.

## Configuration Change Details

From Document 3, the recent change in the security group is as follows:

- **Resource Identifier**: `sg-1234567890123`
- **Change Details**: 
  - Added an inbound rule allowing HTTP traffic on port 299 from `0.0.0.0/0`.

## Recommended Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Security Group Rules**:
   - Check the security group `sg-1234567890123` to ensure that the correct ports are open for the frontend service. Remove or modify the rule allowing traffic on port 299 if it is incorrect.

2. **Review ALB Configuration**:
   - Investigate the ALB `Servic-PetSi-OcbZLiL0VAGu/123456789012` for any misconfigurations. Ensure that the target groups and listeners are correctly set up.

3. **Analyze X-Ray Data**:
   - Use AWS X-Ray to further investigate the performance issues with the `PetSite` service. Look for any specific segments or services that are causing delays or faults.

4. **Check Service Logs**:
   - Review the logs for the `PetSite` service to identify any errors or exceptions that could be causing the performance issues.
